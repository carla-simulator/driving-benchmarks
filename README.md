CARLA Driving Benchmarks Repository
===================================


This repository was made in order to store different driving benchmarks
that run on the [CARLA simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla)

Right now we have available the following benchmarks:

Version 0.8.4:

* CoRL2017 - [Docs](Docs/benchmark_start.md/#corl-2017) / [Paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v78/dosovitskiy17a/dosovitskiy17a.pdf).

* CARLA100 - [Docs](Docs/benchmark_start.md/#carla100) /[Paper] (out soon)




We are working on having a 0.9.X version of the CoRL2017 Benchmark.
We happily accept new benchmarks as pull requests.
